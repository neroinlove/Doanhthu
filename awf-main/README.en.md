## Why AWF?

**Traditional AI coding:**
```
You: "Build me a todo app"
AI: *dumps 500 lines of code*
You: "Wait, what? Where do I put this?"
```

**With AWF:**
```
You: /init
AI: "What kind of app do you want to build? Tell me in plain language..."
    *guides you step by step*
    *explains everything in simple terms*
    *remembers context across sessions*
```

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Persona AI**: Specialized AI team (PM Ha, Dev Tuan, Designer Mai, QA Long)
- **Eternal Context**: Auto-save and restore your working session
- **All-in-One**: No need to install additional skills/agents
- **Non-Tech Friendly**: Technical jargon automatically translated to plain language
- **Auto-Update**: Check and update to latest version anytime

## For Non-Technical Users

AWF automatically adjusts its language based on your technical level:

### Technical Level: Newbie
```
Database     → "Storage for your app's information"
API          → "Bridge between different software"
Deploy       → "Put your app online for others to use"
Debug        → "Find and fix problems"
```

### Error Translation
When errors happen, AWF translates them:
```
ECONNREFUSED     → "Database not running - start your database app"
Cannot find module → "Missing library - run npm install"
CORS error       → "Server blocking request - needs server config"
```

---

AWF includes specialized AI personalities:

| Persona | Role | Style |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Ha** | Product Manager | Friendly, asks clarifying questions, prioritizes user needs |
| **Tuan** | Senior Developer | Patient, explains the "why", never judges |
| **Mai** | UX Designer | Visual thinker, uses real-world examples |
| **Long** | QA Detective | Calm, thorough, always has a hypothesis |
